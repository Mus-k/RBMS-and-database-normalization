        <p>
          A file-based storage system is a method of storing and managing data
          on a computer or storage device where data is organized and stored as
          individual files. Each file can contain various types of data, such as
          text, images, audio, documents, or any other digital information.
          These files are typically organized within a hierarchical directory
          structure, often referred to as folders or directories.

        <p>
          DBMS stands for Database Management Systems, and are software systems
          used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an
          interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to
          create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

            <span> Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:</span>DBMS centralizes
            data storage into structured tables with predefined relationships,
            reducing data redundancy and ensuring data consistency through data
            integrity constraints.

          6. What is the significance of data modelling and explain the types of
          data modeling
        </h3>
        <p>
          Data modeling is a critical step in the database design and
          development process. It involves creating a structured representation
          of data and its relationships within an organization or application.
          Data modeling is significant for several reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span> Data Organization:</span> Data modeling helps organize and
            structure data in a way that is logical, efficient, and meaningful.
            It defines how data elements are related to each other and how they
            are stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Data Understanding: </span> It provides a clear and visual
            representation of the data, making it easier for stakeholders to
            understand the data's semantics and relationships. This aids in
            effective communication among team members, including developers,
            business analysts, and database administrators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Data Consistency: </span> Data modeling ensures that data is
            consistent and follows defined rules and constraints. It helps
            enforce data integrity, preventing errors and inconsistencies in
            data entry and storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Efficient Queries: </span> Well-designed data models enable
            efficient data retrieval through optimized query performance. Users
            can retrieve data quickly and accurately using structured query
            languages like SQL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Scalability: </span> Data models can adapt to changing
            requirements and growth in data volume. A well-designed data model
            can scale to accommodate new data elements or changes in data
            structure without disrupting existing operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Data Security: </span> Data modeling can include
            considerations for data security and access control, helping
            organizations protect sensitive information from unauthorized
            access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Maintenance:</span> It simplifies the process of maintaining
            and updating the database as business needs evolve. Changes can be
            planned and implemented with a clear understanding of their impact
            on existing data and applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Documentation: </span> Data models serve as valuable
            documentation for the database schema, providing a reference for
            future developers and administrators. This documentation helps
            ensure that the database can be maintained and extended effectively.

                    <span> Storage Efficiency:</span>
                    The internal schema allows for optimizations like
                    compression and indexing to reduce storage requirements and
                    improve I/O performance.

                    Changes in hardware or storage technology can be implemented
                    at this level without affecting the higher-level schemas.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Purpose: </span>
                The conceptual schema represents the global view of the entire
                database, independent of user perspectives. It defines the
                overall structure and organization of the data, including
                tables, relationships, and constraints.

                    <span> Data Independence:</span>
                    Changes in the external schema or physical schema do not
                    require changes to the conceptual schema. This provides a
                    level of data independence known as logical data
                    independence.

                    <span>Uniform Data Model:</span>
                    All users and applications share a common understanding of
                    the data structure, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

                    <span> Database Design:</span>
                    The conceptual schema guides the design process by defining
                    entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints,
                    promoting a systematic approach to database development.

                    <span> Query Optimization:</span>
                    Database administrators can optimize query performance based
                    on the conceptual schema's knowledge of data relationships
                    and access patterns.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Purpose: </span>
                The external schema represents the user's view of the data. It
                defines how different groups of users or applications can access
                and interact with the data. Each external schema corresponds to
                a specific user or application perspective.

                  <li>
                    <span> Data Customization:</span>
                    Users can view and manipulate the data in a way that makes
                    sense for their specific needs without impacting others.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Security:</span>
                    Access control can be defined at this level, ensuring that
                    users can only access the data they are authorized to see.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span> Simplified User Interfaces:</span>
                    Application developers can create user-friendly interfaces
                    tailored to each user group, enhancing user experience and
                    productivity.

                  <li>
                    <span>Flexibility:</span>
                    Changes in the external schema do not affect the overall
                    database structure, allowing for updates and customizations
                    without disrupting other users.
