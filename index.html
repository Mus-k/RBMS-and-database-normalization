        <h3>2.Explain the relationship data model in depth.</h3>
        <p>
          The relational data model is a fundamental concept in the field of
          database management systems (DBMS). The relational model represents
          data as sets of tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Tables (Relations):</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tables are used to store data in the relational model. They are
                also referred to as "relations."
              </li>
              <li>
                Each table has a name that uniquely identifies it within the
                database schema.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tables consist of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each
                row represents a single record or data instance, while each
                column represents a specific attribute or property of the data.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rows in a table represent individual data records or instances.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each row is uniquely identified by a primary key, which is a
                column or a combination of columns that ensures the uniqueness
                of each row in the table.

                Columns represent specific attributes or properties of the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each column has a name that uniquely identifies it within the
                table.
              </li>
              <li>
                Columns have a data type that specifies the kind of data that
                can be stored in them (e.g., integers, strings, dates).
              </li>
              <li>
                Columns can have constraints, such as data type constraints,
                unique constraints, and foreign key constraints, which enforce
                data integrity rules.

              <li>
                Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns that
                uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that there
                are no duplicate rows in the table.
              </li>
              <li>
                Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one
                table that refers to the primary key of another table. It
                enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in the
                foreign key column(s) match values in the referenced primary key
                column(s) in the related table.

          4. Explain the different types of Keys in RDBMS considering a

        </h3>
        <p>
          In a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), keys are used to
          uniquely identify and establish relationships between records in
          tables. Each key type serves a specific purpose in maintaining data
          integrity and facilitating efficient data retrieval.

            <span> Primary Key (PK)</span>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Definition</span>A primary key uniquely identifies each
                record (row) in a table. It ensures that there are no duplicate
                values within the key column, and it cannot contain NULL values.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Example</span> In the "Books" table, you can have a
                primary key named "BookID" that uniquely identifies each book.
                This ID is typically an auto-incrementing integer value,
                ensuring every book has a unique identifier.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Definition </span>A foreign key establishes a link between
                two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It
                enforces referential integrity, ensuring that values in the
                foreign key column match existing values in the referenced
                primary key column.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Example</span> In the "Loans" table, you might have a
                foreign key named "BorrowerID" that references the "Borrowers"
                table's primary key, linking each loan to a specific borrower.
                This ensures that loans are only associated with valid
                borrowers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A unique key, like a primary key,
                enforces uniqueness within a column but allows NULL values. It
                ensures that no duplicate non-NULL values exist in the specified
                column.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Example </span> In the "Borrowers" table, you could have
                a unique key on the "Email" column to ensure that no two
                borrowers share the same email address, but it allows some
                borrowers not to provide an email address.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A candidate key is a column or set of
                columns that could potentially become a primary key. It
                satisfies the uniqueness and non-null requirements but hasn't
                been selected as the primary key yet.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Example</span> In the "Borrowers" table, both "BorrowerID"
                and "LibraryCardNumber" could serve as candidate keys, as they
                meet the criteria for primary keys. The database designer would
                choose one to be the actual primary key.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A composite key is a combination of two
                or more columns used together to uniquely identify records
                within a table. Individually, the columns may not be unique, but
                their combination is.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Example </span> In the "Loans" table, you might use a
                composite key consisting of "BookID" and "BorrowerID" to
                uniquely identify each loan, as a single borrower can borrow
                multiple copies of the same book.

              <li>
                <span> Definition</span>
                A super key is a set of one or more columns that can uniquely
                identify records in a table. It may contain more columns than
                necessary to form a minimal key.

              <li>
                <span>Example </span> In the "Books" table, a super key could be
                a combination of "ISBN" and "Author," as this combination could
                uniquely identify books. However, it's not a minimal super key
                because just "ISBN" alone would suffice.

        <p>
          The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the concept that any

                <span> One Reason to Change: </span>

                SRP suggests that a class should have only one reason to change,
                meaning it should have only one responsibility or purpose. This
                principle encourages high cohesion, where a class focuses on

                <span>Readability and Maintainability: </span>
                Code that follows SRP is more readable because the

            structure data in a way that is logical, efficient, and meaningful.
            It defines how data elements are related to each other and how they
            are stored.

            different types of errors that could arise in a denormalized
            database:
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Data Redundancy Errors: </span>Denormalization often involves
            duplicating data across multiple tables or columns. This redundancy
            can lead to data inconsistency if updates or modifications are not
            handled correctly. If data is duplicated, and one copy is updated
            while the other is not, it can result in discrepancies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Insertion and Deletion Anomalies: </span>Denormalization can
            lead to insertion and deletion anomalies. Insertion anomalies occur
            when it's challenging to insert new data into the database due to
            dependencies on duplicated data. Deletion anomalies occur when
            removing a record from one part of the denormalized database leads
            to unintended data loss or inconsistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Update Anomalies: </span> Update anomalies occur when changes
            to a single piece of data need to be made in multiple places due to
            data duplication. If updates are not synchronized, it can lead to
            inconsistencies in the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Increased Storage Requirements: </span> Denormalization
            typically increases storage requirements since data is duplicated.
            This can lead to wasted storage space and increased costs for
            database storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Performance Trade-offs:</span>
            While denormalization is often done to improve data retrieval
            performance by reducing the need for complex joins, it can lead to
            slower data modification operations. This trade-off should be
            carefully considered based on the specific needs of the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Inefficient Queries: </span> Denormalization can also lead to
            inefficient queries in some cases. Queries that require aggregations
            or filtering on denormalized data may be slower than equivalent
            queries on a normalized database.
          </li>
          <!--  -->
          <li>
            <span> Increased Risk of Data Anomalies: </span> With redundant
            data, there is an increased risk of data anomalies and
            inconsistencies, especially if updates are not handled rigorously.
            These anomalies can be challenging to identify and resolve.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span> Inflexibility: </span>

            A denormalized database may be less flexible when it comes to
            accommodating changes in the data schema. As new requirements arise,
            adapting a denormalized structure can be more difficult than
            adjusting a normalized schema.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Maintenance Challenges: </span>Over time, as the database
            grows and evolves, maintaining consistency and ensuring that
            redundancy is managed effectively can become a significant
            challenge.

          7. What is normalization and what is the need for normalization?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Normalization, in the context of databases, is a process of organizing
          data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data
          integrity.
