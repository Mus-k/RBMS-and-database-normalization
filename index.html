        <h3>2.Explain the relationship data model in depth.</h3>
        <p>
          The relational data model is a fundamental concept in the field of
          database management systems (DBMS). The relational model represents
          data as sets of tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.

            <span>Tables (Relations):</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tables are used to store data in the relational model. They are
                also referred to as "relations."
              </li>
              <li>
                Each table has a name that uniquely identifies it within the
                database schema.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tables consist of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each
                row represents a single record or data instance, while each
                column represents a specific attribute or property of the data.
              </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rows in a table represent individual data records or instances.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each row is uniquely identified by a primary key, which is a
                column or a combination of columns that ensures the uniqueness
                of each row in the table.

              <li>
                Each column has a name that uniquely identifies it within the
                table.
              </li>
              <li>
                Columns have a data type that specifies the kind of data that
                can be stored in them (e.g., integers, strings, dates).
              </li>
              <li>
                Columns can have constraints, such as data type constraints,
                unique constraints, and foreign key constraints, which enforce
                data integrity rules.

                In the relational model, keys are used to establish
                relationships between tables and enforce data integrity.

              <li>
                Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns that
                uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that there
                are no duplicate rows in the table.

              <li>
                Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one
                table that refers to the primary key of another table. It
                enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in the
                foreign key column(s) match values in the referenced primary key
                column(s) in the related table.

        </h3>
        <p>
          In a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), keys are used to
          uniquely identify and establish relationships between records in
          tables. Each key type serves a specific purpose in maintaining data

            <span> Primary Key (PK)</span>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Definition</span>A primary key uniquely identifies each
                record (row) in a table. It ensures that there are no duplicate
                values within the key column, and it cannot contain NULL values.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Example</span> In the "Books" table, you can have a
                primary key named "BookID" that uniquely identifies each book.
                This ID is typically an auto-incrementing integer value,
                ensuring every book has a unique identifier.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Definition </span>A foreign key establishes a link between
                two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It
                enforces referential integrity, ensuring that values in the
                foreign key column match existing values in the referenced
                primary key column.

              <li>
                <span> Example</span> In the "Loans" table, you might have a
                foreign key named "BorrowerID" that references the "Borrowers"
                table's primary key, linking each loan to a specific borrower.
                This ensures that loans are only associated with valid
                borrowers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A unique key, like a primary key,
                enforces uniqueness within a column but allows NULL values. It
                ensures that no duplicate non-NULL values exist in the specified
                column.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Example </span> In the "Borrowers" table, you could have
                a unique key on the "Email" column to ensure that no two
                borrowers share the same email address, but it allows some
                borrowers not to provide an email address.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A candidate key is a column or set of
                columns that could potentially become a primary key. It
                satisfies the uniqueness and non-null requirements but hasn't
                been selected as the primary key yet.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Example</span> In the "Borrowers" table, both "BorrowerID"
                and "LibraryCardNumber" could serve as candidate keys, as they
                meet the criteria for primary keys. The database designer would
                choose one to be the actual primary key.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span> Definition</span> A composite key is a combination of two
                or more columns used together to uniquely identify records
                within a table. Individually, the columns may not be unique, but
                their combination is.

              <li>
                <span>Example </span> In the "Loans" table, you might use a
                composite key consisting of "BookID" and "BorrowerID" to
                uniquely identify each loan, as a single borrower can borrow
                multiple copies of the same book.

              <li>
                <span> Definition</span>
                A super key is a set of one or more columns that can uniquely
                identify records in a table. It may contain more columns than
                necessary to form a minimal key.

                <span>Example </span> In the "Books" table, a super key could be
                a combination of "ISBN" and "Author," as this combination could
                uniquely identify books. However, it's not a minimal super key
                because just "ISBN" alone would suffice.

                <span> One Reason to Change: </span>

                SRP suggests that a class should have only one reason to change,
                meaning it should have only one responsibility or purpose. This
                principle encourages high cohesion, where a class focuses on

                Code that follows SRP is more readable because the
